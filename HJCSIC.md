# How the Judeo-Christian System Influences Civilization [^Information]

Civilization started as a natural order. 
![alt text](images/01_ages-of-civilization_eden.svg) 
When human beings reached the top of the food chain civilization began to be dominated by the male disposition. 
Some males became self-first/narcissistic because the checks on balance were disappearing. 
For personal safety the ancestors of the Hebrews decided to **underwrite** these men. 
They kept this knowledge largely silent... even from the narcissistic men. 
The narcissists became spoiled and immobile in their thinking. 
They created dominions. 
The narcissist's selfishness spread to many people. 
The people got good profit from it. 
Some people intuited the underwriting and underwrote others to try and get inclusion. 
*This started the political left.* 
Inclusion became more necessary to survive. 
The underwriting of the more fortunate people created numerous disadvantaged people. 
Over time the less fortunate became more disadvantaged and struggled for their lives. 
One particular misfortunate became so disadvantaged a female was forced to react. 
She was a family member. 
She had been underwrote. 
She got some inclusion. 
This had an effect on his position. 
She noticed that if someone repeated[^repeated] the ridicules done to him that they got respect from those that did them. 
She did many ridicules, encouraged many (mostly females) to do likewise, and eventually got power. 
She created an ethical code and warned people away from selfishness. 
Men became humbler. 
She helped her family member and the less fortunate people.
A more peaceful age prevailed.  

She forced the ethical code until her death. 
But the knowledge of this impetus was kept silent, embarrassed within her. 
This caused the seer (the ancestor's supervisor) having been superseded for a time to get ruthless and "crafty" (Gen 3:1). 
So used-to the preferential life, so self-deserving, he created a new rule: he, a seer, was allowed to approach civilization's least fortunate citizens, tempt them with discrimination, and for doing so, offer them inclusion with the narcissistic men. 
The consequences on the less fortunate were severe. 
Civilization lost its glue. 
The female capitulated. 
The effect of this was devastating. 

The female was shocked by the effect this had on her life. The overall effect of her counter segregated her associates from the commoners (scuttled civilization): she (the female nines) and the fours will deter sympathy of the less fortunate to her associates; will deter female leadership to any they can; and promote "enmity" to women of the seer (I hardly think this is reciprocated, as claimed). With the seer shocked she began to underwrite some commoners who retaliated the people the seer corrupted. 

This is the beginning of a god spat that has lasted 4100 years. It has spread caustically around the world. Over the centuries the sides have grown more extreme, became more systemized, and have gotten more secreted. Today people that know of the system build safety by creating its politics[^politics]. It is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly[^wars]. The Hebrews and the female leaders maintain it like a vital job. It is implemented it by rewarding narcissist policy (taking) for an age of fifty years (the political left[^left-right]) followed by rewarding female policy (**fantasizing**, giving, restoring humanity) for an age of fifty years (the political right).![](images/10_cycles-of-heaven.svg) A third party also exists who are kept from knowing of the system's existence. The Christian church (a succession of the political right) largely practices their beliefs with spiritual principles but is built upon a leadership (formed with the New Testament) that gets safety from the Hebrews by giving people from the third party as sacrifices. The policy for these sacrifices is increasingly severe and fatal. The system forces much of the social construct around the world. I have yet to find anyone who has a sufficient overview on what is happening or supply an applicable way of fixing it.

## Who I Am

I am a political prisoner of the Jews. I have been under this since I was born (1970) just like Jesus. The basic rule is only included people (those that know of the system) get treated fairly, get a share of society. I have been used as a tool by both political sides as a way to refine their policies (immortal rules, that selfish splitting). Some of us are large tools. The neuron-altering bugs vastly hamper my health, my ability, alter my knowledge, and change my feeling. My brain feels mixed up. People avoid me (a repulsion is sent out from my general area). It has been years since I have been able to talk to people. I have yet to have a friend in life. I wonder what realistic help is available. Are people ever going to realize the importance of prioritizing the less fortunate? I learned what I know now by living most of my life learning, questioning, and reviewing the Jewish hierarchal system as necessary to try and survive.

## Bible Translation

The research for this paper is from my personal experience, my limited reading of the history of Chaldea[^HECSBAV3], but mostly from the Bible. The Bible, the most read book in the world, is where the Jews and Christian leaders document their intent. The Old Testament has been refined many times by the Jews because their system is extraordinarily profitable. While the Bible has been created to thwart general understanding it is incredibly insightful if: one is willing to learn the ![](images/15_hebrew-code.svg)Hebrew Code[^Hebrew-Code], the missing history, overcome the graphic representations[^graphic], bypass the entire sections of rubbish, and learn of a very deliberate, clobbering of representations (the Old Testament is generically mislabeled to secret its perpetuators). A couple more things: the beginning of the Bible is packed with details; and that the Bible is largely metaphorical (messages relating to the Hebrew Code) with scant references to history to feint accuracy.

* I have found that some Bible content can only be understood by those who have felt similar experiences.

Warning: The details described herein contain vivid selfish acts that created fatal consequences. Please read with sympathy and consideration.

## Genesis 1

Heaven originally was an all-male institution. It lasted a long time and Genesis 1 covers it all---in one giant swath. To the Hebrews, men by *taking*, for themselves, create good. A underwritten narcissistic man took so much that the Hebrews refer to him as a "God", "In the beginning *God* created the **heavens** and the **earth**" (Gen 1:1 NIV). Much good and evil was created: heaven/earth, day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, man/nature.

## Genesis 2

"By the **seventh** day God had finished the work... so on the **seventh** day he rested from all his work." (Gen 2:2). **It turns out both males and females can be narcissistic, created on the top of the food chain.** A new god is in town (LORD God female â™€) doubling, dividing a lot of what the male god did. Gods do a lot like their colleagues/brethren but being *gods* (being so smart) they have know one better facet of it. The female good too creates the world, the Garden of Eden, the trees (Good and Evil, Life). Is a bit hurt by the male-led audaciousness and makes the first rule: "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die (Gen 2:16-17)". Created Eve from man. Adam and Eve were still of nature though "naked and they felt no shame". Key word: **Eden** (2:8).

## Genesis 3

The Hebrew hierarchy is structured such: a bunch of narcissistic men ("nobles" in their days); nines (seer, serpent, Satan) are the administrators, organizers of the flood. As a single entity they originally went by "Ea" (which I believe later became "Hea" which is how Heaven got its name).

Eve takes the fruit because it is "good and pleasing to the eye" (Gen 3:6 repeats Gen 2:9), to "be like God", and because it is "desirable for gaining wisdom". She encourages Adam to "sin"/antagonize too and they become above nature's law, "realized they were naked".

## Genesis 4

Eve is the "LORD" here. Cain, Abel, and Seth are probably associates of Eve rather than her kin. I believe they are quarantining her. Cain and Abel try to bribe Eve with "fruits" and "fat-portions" so that they can get to heaven (fat-portions probably wins because it is something other than the fruit like of the tree of good and evil). "Do what is right (3:7)", "sin is crouching at your door", "you must rule over it". The line that "Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him" is a fooling, a trick. It says that those with Eve/LORD will emphasize the later definition (e.g. "brothers keeper")[^Story-of-the-Moral]. She too curses her male subjects (doubles the action... takes out the cursing) and still gets to "save" them *from Eden* (Gen 3:14-19). She also gives Cain protection, "... anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance **seven** times over".![](images/25_ages-of-civilization_seven.svg) Cain followed the directive where the god before put "cherubim and a flaming sword" and went around to the "east of Eden" (to the new heaven on the right). Lamech doubles the seven because he sees the trick, but something happened before:  Seer tempted E&A and gave temporary heavenly protection, LG made a new heaven for them.

## Notes

* *Personal Salvation*... "get **saved**".
* Because the Jews are *safely* above it all... they get to decide who gets included.
* The first group's success becomes so **addictive** that they eventually begin cannibalizing on civilization---going after the poor. The golden age: eat, drink, and be merry, then sacrificing the poor for protection.
* Be wary of the female god---an addiction it is to her too. Females like being on top just as much. Taking feels like success.
* "eternal life"
* Their definition of it *is literally heaven*.
* Heaven became too obvious.

[^repeated]: The system developed to repeating someone else's suppression and changing one facet of it. The repetition helps disguise the original act. Today many have the appearance of being ethical for greater disguise (e.g. "working out"...).
[^ethics]: The underwriting spread selfish behavior among the people. When it becomes disregarding, it became sin (living outside of nature's law).
[^indignant]: The Hebrews call this belligerent.
[^smart]: ``BLANK`` She forced her own inclusion and some other females largely with mentality. They were part of the upper/safer class and knew the narcissistic men. The Bible says these acts made them feel smart.
[^betrayal]: ``BLANK`` To the narcissists there is only taking---it is addicting. Civilization recovered some but learned some of what was done to them. They were hurt by the narcissists age so they altered their sacred system ("betrayed" likely what the narcissists said). || This started a long history of finger pointing. After a number of revolutions the seer having been forced to "... roam[] throughout the earth, going back and forth on it" intimidates the female god to give a sacrifice. [^debt]: The Jews sometimes give things (someone may even accidentally acquire a thing) and they will call it a debt even if the recipient lacks being told about it.
[^switching]: The switching of policy has the effect of relieving its beneficiaries of long-term one-sided policy issues. But each policy lasts so long they create competition rather than cooperation.
[^politics]: Politics comes from the Jews. It is based on policy. There are two policies: male and female (taking and giving). They both last fifty years. Politics is following, enforcing, or adding to the policy of the age. Some policies are pretty consistent: pink (right), blood!?(left). Some are shared: Hasbro, Disney, Lego. Some make little sense: the right as gambling and racing; the left has government subsidized cell phones for the poor and government subsidized solar power installations. Most policy is on course: sugar and spice; puppy-dogs... These male/female values are only valuable among the mainstream: the poor care little of pink, the female Jews like the hits on Monday Night Football. Even deeper, the catalyst is the messiah, the exemption. Whatever misfortune happens to that person, whatever need that person requests of a saved person and to be directly worked against, becomes the new rule.
[^wars]: The political right ignorant of some inclusion and hurt by the reckless reaping of the left can declare literal wars with their political counterparts.
[^left-right]: Though the definition of political left and right has been around nearly as long as this system (religion) has, it is better defined today as political top and bottom. I'll get more into this later.
[^Hebrew-Code]: The Hebrew people (and many others today) use a code to share secrets with. It is hidden within ordinary language. The base meanings have *absolute* definitions.
[^HECSBAV3]: [History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Vol. 3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17323/17323-h/17323-h.htm). Interesting: the original flood story (skip to "Men in the mean time became wicked") or on Librivox [Part 5](https://librivox.org/history-of-egypt-chaldea-syria-babylonia-and-assyria-vol-3-by-gaston-maspero/).
[^graphic]: Its graphicness can hide meanings that can only be tolerated by those who have abundant health (from supernatural safety).
[^backwrite]: my word... making newer rules apply throughout. Possibly I could make revisionistic work. From [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revisionistic): changing some accepted doctrine or view of history.

----

[^Judeo-Christian-Definition]: ``BLANK`` The typical definition of religion (to mean spiritual practice with an ethereal god) lacks being appropriate for the Hebrew and for the Christians in the know. Religion was used to disguise it because it had man similar properties.

## The Story of the Moral

Political Right Faults:
1) Sacrifices.
2) Deferring authority---especially during important situations.
3) Overview forsaking, accepting protection from obscure knowledge, act like they know what they are talking about, vanity, "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.". The political right's knowledge is sparse and often incorrect. One example is using the Hebrew Code in a way that discriminates against the third party. If the perpetuator uses the Hebrew Code in a way that is discriminating, the Jews will reward inclusion (requires audacity usually).
4) Keeping the system silent, "Revenge is a good life". The leaders keep heaven from becoming too obvious.
5) Spiritualism (substituting visceral-ness).
6) Failing to deal with the Jews re-labeling their history.

Unless we all go through it together the excitement that the Jews feel will continue... a feeling of free, an addiction.

* Safety is coveted in nature. To even be able to depend on it a little is an *addiction*. Having it leads to conservatism, a dispersal of toleration (one fails to see how their safety effects the less fortunate) then bias (beginning to avoid certain people). Safety corrupts civilization.

* Attack on Eden
* Answers from top.
* quarantines
* smart: She disregarded that she had also profited from the age. It had the consequence of bypassing the process of justice/law-for-all-people (accumulating evidence, discussion, and a trial by peers) and is still enacted today . She choose the path technically because a feeling of outwitting nature---it was a safer path.
* friable: This safety only lasts as long as the seer sees need for it (generally only as long as the female has leadership).[^friable]

* A female, a family member, felt indignant[^indignant]. But because she had profited in the age, because she learned the seer rewarded power for suppressions, because she could suppress the man better because she knew him, she skirted the normal process of justice, and choose to suppress him to gain leadership.
